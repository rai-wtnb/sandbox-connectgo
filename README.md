## sandbox-connectgo
- This is demo code that implements [connect-go's Getting started](https://connect.build/docs/go/getting-started).
- Whatâ€™s more, I added Interceptor, reflection setting using [connect-grpcreflect-go](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-grpcreflect-go), error handling, and so on.
